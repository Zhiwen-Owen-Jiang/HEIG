# Highly-Efficient Imaging Genetics (HEIG)
`HEIG` is a statistical framework for conducting joint analysis for large-scale imaging and genetic data. Currently, `HEIG` is capable of performing voxelwise genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) on images for unrelated subjects, as well as heritability analysis for each voxel, genetic correlation analysis for a pair of voxels, and cross-trait genetic correlation between a voxel and non-imaging phenotype using summary statistics.
